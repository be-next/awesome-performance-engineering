# Awesome Performance Engineering

A curated, opinionated collection of tools and resources dedicated to **Performance Engineering**, covering both **Observability** and **Performance Testing**.

This repository follows the spirit of the *awesome* manifesto: concise, useful, community‑driven, and focused on quality rather than exhaustiveness.

## 🎯 Why this repository exists

Performance issues are rarely caused by a single component or a single tool. They emerge from complex interactions between architectures, workloads, data, infrastructure, and usage patterns.

This repository was created with a clear intent:

> **To promote a performance engineering mindset**, where observability and performance testing are not isolated activities, but complementary practices forming a continuous improvement loop.

Rather than a simple catalog, this project aims to:

* Highlight **production‑grade, field‑proven tools**
* Encourage **realistic testing and data simulation**
* Bridge the gap between **testing, observability, and analysis**
* Help practitioners choose tools **adapted to their context and maturity**

## 📋 Curated Lists

### 🔭 Awesome Observability Tools

📄 **[awesome-observability-tools.md](awesome-observability-tools.md)**

A curated list of tools enabling deep visibility into modern, distributed systems.

Covered domains include:

* Metrics collection & time‑series databases
* Distributed tracing
* Log management & log pipelines
* Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
* Profiling & continuous performance analysis
* Visualization, dashboards & analytics
* Open standards and instrumentation frameworks

The focus is on tools that support:

* High‑throughput and large‑scale systems
* Cloud‑native and hybrid architectures
* Production diagnostics and root‑cause analysis

👉 **Goal:** observe systems as they really behave, not as we assume they behave.

---

### 🚀 Awesome Performance Testing Tools

📄 **[awesome-performance-testing-tools.md](awesome-performance-testing-tools.md)**

A curated list of tools covering the full **performance engineering lifecycle**, not limited to load generation.

Included categories:

* Load and traffic generators
* Protocol‑level and API‑level testing tools
* Service virtualization, mocks and stubs
* Data generation and dataset simulation
* Browser and frontend performance testing
* Chaos engineering and fault injection
* Scenario orchestration and test automation

Special attention is given to tools that:

* Enable **realistic workloads and data volumes**
* Integrate well with CI/CD pipelines
* Complement observability platforms

👉 **Goal:** test systems under conditions that are as close as possible to real life.

## 🧭 Performance Engineering Perspective

Throughout both lists, tools are selected and categorized with a performance engineering perspective in mind:

* 🧪 **PoC‑friendly** – suitable for experimentation and early validation
* 🏭 **Production‑grade** – proven in real‑world, high‑load environments
* ☁️ **Cloud‑native** – designed for Kubernetes and elastic infrastructures
* 🧱 **Legacy‑friendly** – usable in constrained or older environments
* 🚄 **High‑throughput** – optimized for large volumes and low overhead

These indicators are not absolute truths but **guidance signals**, based on field experience and community feedback.

## 🔍 Quality & Maintenance

This repository relies on automated quality checks:

* Link validation (PR, main branch, scheduled)
* Markdown linting
* Spell checking

Automation helps, but **curation remains a human responsibility**.

---

## 📚 Learning Resources

Both lists include references to:

* Books and long‑form articles
* Official documentation and specifications
* Community blogs and talks
* Standards and best practices related to performance engineering

The intent is to support **learning and skill progression**, not just tool selection.
